Web applications commonly need a way of authenticating users. This crate provides an easy and secure way to do this, integrating with Humphrey using the `AuthApp` trait and allowing complete control over the database users are stored in. Humphrey Auth does not come with a database, but the `AuthDatabase` trait is implemented for `Vec<User>` to get started. For a production use, you should use a proper database and implement the `AuthDatabase` trait for it.
