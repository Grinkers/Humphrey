# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this project is still a work-in-progress, older versions are not being supported with security updates. Only the latest version should be considered secure, and any projects using Humphrey should ensure that the dependency is kept up-to-date.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in the project, please send an email to [security@whenderson.dev](mailto:security@whenderson.dev) as soon as possible, detailing how to reproduce the vulnerability. Please do not open an issue or a pull request fixing it yourself. If the vulnerability is accepted, a fix will be implemented and released, then the vulnerability will be disclosed on the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/w-henderson/Humphrey/security/advisories) page.
