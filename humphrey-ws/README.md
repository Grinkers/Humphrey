Humphrey WebSocket is a crate which extends Humphrey Core with WebSocket support by hooking into the latter's `WebsocketHandler` trait. It handles the WebSocket handshake and framing protocol and provides a simple and flexible API for sending and receiving messages. Using Humphrey's generic `Stream` type, it supports drop-in TLS. It also has no dependencies in accordance with Humphrey's goals of being dependency-free.
