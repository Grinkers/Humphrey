# Introduction

Humphrey is a very fast, robust and flexible HTTP/1.1 web server. It provides both an executable web server, similar to Nginx, and a Rust crate for building your own web applications. In this guide, you'll get a strong understanding of how to use and build upon both components.

The executable web server component of the project is often referred to as "Humphrey Server", and you can learn how to install, configure and run it [here](server/index.md). It also supports plugins, which provide limitless extensibility of the server and the creation of which is also covered in this guide.

The underlying Rust crate is often referred to as "Humphrey Core", and provides a framework for building web applications. You can learn how to set up and build your own web application using Humphrey Core [here](core/index.md).
