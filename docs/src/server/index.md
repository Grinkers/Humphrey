# Humphrey Server
Humphrey is a very fast, robust and flexible HTTP/1.1 web server, with support for static and dynamic content through its plugin system. It has no dependencies when only using default features, and is easily extensible with a configuration file and dynamically-loaded plugins.

This section of the guide will cover the following topics:

1. [Installing and running Humphrey Server](getting-started.md)
2. [Exploring the configuration file](configuration.md)
3. [Using PHP with Humphrey Server](using-php.md)
4. [Serving content over HTTPS](https.md)
5. [Creating your own plugin](plugin/creating-a-plugin.md)

This section requires no prior knowledge, with the exception of the plugin creation section, which requires knowledge of the Rust programming language.
