# Humphrey JSON
Humphrey JSON is a simple JSON library for Rust, and provides a number of features for working with JSON data. In accordance with Humphrey's principles, it has no dependencies.

This section of the guide will cover the following topics:

1. [Working with untyped JSON data](untyped-values.md)
2. [Manipulating JSON using strongly-typed Rust data structures](data-structures.md)

The Humphrey JSON crate is very similar in concept and API to `serde_json`, so familiarity with the latter is very helpful. Much of Serde's documentation applies here as well.
